# Library System

### Libraries Used
1. [iostream](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-input-output-c/)
2. [vector](geeksforgeeks.org/vector-in-cpp-stl/)
### Data Structures implemented
1. [**Arrays**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-array/)   
   - Arrays were used to store the usernames and passwords of admins. 
2. [**Vectors**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-in-cpp-stl/)
   - These were used to simulate the shelf with books in a library as well as to implement the queue for student requests.
4. [**Linked List**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/)   
   - This data structure was used to create the default student accounts and the accounts that users register.
5. [**Queues**]()      
   - The requests that students make to borrow or return a book are put into a queue(using vectors) that admins can process.
### Algorithms implemented
1. [**Linear Search**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-search/)
   + One of the options that somebody trying to login as an admin has to verify their account's validity.
   + Also used to verify a student's account when they try to login.
   + Used to display available books and unavailable books for students.
   + Used to display all the books whether available or unavailable for admins.
2. [**Binary Search**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/)
   + One of the options that somebody trying to login as an admin has to verify their account's validity.
